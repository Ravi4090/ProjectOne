# ProjectOne
This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of implementing Continuous Integration (CI) practices for a simple Java calculator application. It showcases the integration of unit testing using JUnit, build automation with Apache Maven, continuous integration with Jenkins, and the use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) solely for hosting Jenkins and executing build jobs. The focus is on automating the testing process, ensuring code quality, and leveraging cloud infrastructure for CI workflows.
